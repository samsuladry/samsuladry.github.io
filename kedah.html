          <button type="button" class="accordion">History</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="smallfont">Kedah is the 8th largest state by land area and 8th most populated state in Malaysia, with a total land area of 9,500 km2 (3,700 sq mi), and a population of 1,890,098. The Pedu Lake is the largest man-made lake in the state.</p>
            <p class="smallfont">Kedah has a relatively heterogeneous populace constituted by three major ethnic groups; the Malays, Chinese and Indians as well as some Malaysian Siamese ethnic groups, similar to most of the other Malaysian states. Prior to the formation of the Federation of Malaya, there was an ethnic group known as the Sam Sam people.</p>
            <p class="smallfont">To the north, Kedah borders the state of Perlis and shares an international boundary with the Songkhla and Yala provinces of Thailand. It borders the states of Perak to the south and Penang to the southwest.</p>

            <li ><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jyfYy2bkoQp" >Stall to Stall in Pekan Rabu</a></li>
            <p class="smallfont">Known to be the pride of Kedah, Pekan Rabu literally means ‘Wednesday Market’, but direct meanings aside, as this market is open not just on Wednesdays, but as well as every other day. Built in the late 1990’s and also having it being renovated, today, the bazaar houses at least 300 stalls up to date that sells a variety of things that is bound to capture the interest of visitors!</p>
            <li ><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/p611Gokh3ho" >The Dayang Bunting Lake</a></li>
            <p class="smallfont">The Dayang Bunting Lake that is on the Dayang Bunting Island itself would be familiar among visitors when their tour guides bring them on a Langkawi island hopping tour. The lake, which is on Langkawi’s second major island, is easily accessible by the boats usually brought by the boatmen. The lake is situated at the middle of the island, surrounded by beautiful flourishing greeneries, making the entire scene seem serene and peaceful.</p>
            <li ><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RbskfbGtQvw" >Bird-Eyes View From Langkawi Cable Car</a></li>
            <p class="smallfont">Located half an hour from Kuah city, the base station of this cable car ride would be at the Oriental Village, south west coast of the island itself. Once visitors are on the cable car, they would be able to see breathtaking views of Langkawi Island as whole, from the forests reserves to the blue green ocean. Having to see Langkawi Island from a birds-eye view would be a thrilling experience to some as they would never have thought to be all the way to the peak of 709 metres! One of the beautiful scenes to look out for while being in one of the cable cars would be the Seven Wells Waterfall.</p>
            <li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J4d3wuv7Rh22">Gunung Jerai, Kedah</a></li>
            <p class="smallfont">Gunung Jerai, or Mount Jerai in English, is the second highest peak in the state of Kedah. It has a historical significance as a navigation point for sailors during ancient Kedah. Standing tall at 1217 metres, it oversees the vast paddy fields of Kedah as well as providing refreshing breeze at the top of the mountain. Visitors can choose to either drive up via its 13-kilometre main road or hike atop the mountain. Via the main road, visitors will pass Sungai Teroi Forest Recreational Park and Forestry Museum, which are worth a stop. Visitors can hike through a forest trail built at the park and learn about the various plans that have been tagged for easy referencing.</p>
